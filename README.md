- For more `angular-cli` commands: `$ ng --help`


## Installation e2e Tests (i.e., tools)

For running *e2e* tests you must need [protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/) and [webdriver-manager](https://github.com/angular/webdriver-manager) globally installed on your machine.
Follow up these commands if you don't have installed yet.

```
# Install webdriver-manager
$ npm install -g webdriver-manager

# Setting up a Selenium Server (By default it will download the selenium server jar and chromedriver binary.)
$ webdriver-manager update

# Install protractor
$ npm install -g protractor
```

After then, you need to first start selenium server anf then run tests:

- Starting the Selenium Server: `$ webdriver-manager start`
i.e., By default, the selenium server will run on `http://localhost:4444/wd/hub`.

- Then, For runing e2e tests: `$ ng e2e`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/route/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.
